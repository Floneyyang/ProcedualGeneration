# ProceduralGeneration

## Overview
I created a procedural generation algorithm for generating a world with terrain, skybox, foreground/background/upground objects. This procedural generation algorithm focuses on generating several features of the world:

- All the foreground objects are randomly generated at any location in a circular flat terrain
- All the background objects are randomly generated in a “donut” shape range where the circular flat terrain will be placed at the center
